### No, no speculative features
We can't review or merge speculative features. If the pipeline operator makes it to stage 3 of the standards process, please port this PR to microsoft/typescript-go.

I'm closing this PR because it is stale and the original issue hasn't been accepted. If the original issue is accepted, we can revisit the PR to see if any of the code is still usable.

Unfortunately, we haven't had time to review this PR and there's no issue showing an intent to add it to Typescript. I think it makes most sense to close this PR and re-open it if something changes.

Unfortunately, we haven't had time to work on the design of one-sided predicates and this PR is quite old now. I think it makes most sense to close this PR and re-open it if something changes.

### No, no unrequested fixes
This PR fixes a bug that's not in the backlog, and we haven't had time to review it, so I'm going to close it.

Big changes to the core lib are unlikely to be successful, mainly for compatibility and but also for performance reasons. It looks to me that both apply to this change.

### No, no outdated test branches
I believe this test branch is unused so I'm closing it. Please re-open it if I'm wrong.

### Already asked to close
Closing due to lack of activity.

### Close

## For Uncommitted Bug

Not updated in the last year. Close "no" with a message "we don't have the ability to review this for Strada. Please port to typescript-go so we can review there.". Close "later" with "this feature should wait until the Corsa port is done. Please port to typescript-go so we can review there."
